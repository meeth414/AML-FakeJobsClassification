      "547) company_profile_Newspaper Club is a service to help anyone make and print their own newspapers. Our mission is to give people the tools to turn whatever they want into newsprint, quickly and easily.The company was founded in 2009 by Ben Terrett, Tom Taylor and Russell Davies, who felt that rumours of print’s death had been greatly exaggerated. And with more reading being done digitally, the joy of holding something physical was more important than ever. As an experiment, they designed a newspaper called Things Our Friends Have Written On The Internet. It delighted people so much that the seeds of Newspaper Club were born.With initial support from Channel 4’s innovation fund 4iP, the team worked on making the process of designing and printing a newspaper easier. The first step, producing a good-looking newspaper without expensive, complicated design software, was solved by the invention of ARTHR – Newspaper Club’s free layout tool. The next step, finding someone to print it on real newsprint, and understanding what on earth they’re talking about was addressed by partnering with established newspaper printers and building an easy-to-use web service, staffed by a team of friendly people.Since then, we've won a Design of the Year award for Graphics in 2010 and a BIMA for Technical Achievement, and we’ve grown to a team of 13, with offices in London, Birmingham and Glasgow.We’ve printed over 6 million newspapers for thousands of customers all over the world, including the BBC, Coca Cola, the Guardian, Penguin Books, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and Sony Records.And yes, we're still excited about printing newspapers. 0.000060\n",

      "591) company_profile_History &amp; Background The Bank started its activities in Feb. 1985 at the time when the economic arena was characterized by major developments, a matter which gave the bank mission special significance, as Egypt was suffering at that time from great pressures on its balance of payments. This was apart from the rising deficit of the balance of trade. Consequently, the external debt problem started to represent a sort of concern to the Egyptian economy in all its sectors.The Bank was founded as a financial institution to boost Egyptian exports. The export development issue is not only an economic policy to cope with the balance of payments problem, but also represents a strategic trend for development policies in a global economy that gets closer and integrated every day. Accordingly, the export sector is a crucial propeller for modernization and development. There are various examples of many small and medium size countries in which the export sector played a significant role in developing their economies.General Trend of Bank Activities Export Development Bank of Egypt adopts special measures such as excellence and quality in playing its pivotal role. Through its distinguished performance, the bank aims to be one of the remarkable financial centers, thus it does not confine its target to attain maximum profitability only, but also to achieve prosperity.Since its inception, the Bank has managed to maintain its identity as a commercial and investment bank; rather than a deposit collecting retail commercial bank. The bank has always been eager to support the export sector through financing investment projects pertaining to such sector, which is contrary to the main philosophy of commercial banks that aim at working capital financing for existing projects. In Egypt common practice has shown that most of the development banks have turned to current operations and deposit gathering, acting as mere commercial banks and thus deviating from their authentic target of being investment and development financial institutions.The bank resorted to opening of new branches and gathering deposits in order to meet its main goal of establishing and boosting a solid export sector. Consequently, the bank persisted on gathering deposits of companies and corporations in order to be a wholesale bank. The bank re-affirmed its geographic presence in export oriented locations like that of Alexandria that was opened in May 1989 and Tenth of Ramadan in September 1989.With the change of the government monetary policy during the early nineties, and the tendency to develop sources of finance through issuing treasury bills and bonds, and lifting subsidized interest rates by all means,  the bank was motivated to establish a network of branches to mobilize financial resources. Accordingly, the network of branches at our bank had increasingly expanded to 21 branches in March 2012.With the beginning of the financial reform in 2004 following the amendment of Central Bank Law, as well as The Banking Sector and Money Law no. 88/2003, Central Bank reclassified all banks thus giving them full freedom to open new branches and promote several saving. Accordingly, the bank had to rectify all its future plans to include branch expansion policy, as well as the new banking products that concern individuals and corporations.  Developments of Bank's Activities :Throughout the life of the Bank that exceeds quarter of a century, EDBE witnessed numerous aspect of development, most significant of which were the following:Ownership :Ownership:Regarding ownership structure, the Bank has endeavored to develop the Egyptian capital market through launching new products in order to assume its basic role as an important source of funding. At first, the bank managed to change its articles of association to allow the private sector and the Egyptian family sector to contribute to its capital. It also aspired to allow its staff to own some shares of its capital part as one kind of propagating the culture of dealing with the capital market and as an incentive to the staff to further foster their loyalty and belonging to the institution in which they work.On the other hand, the Bank managed to establish companies focusing on export development, thus allowing the staff own some shares of their capital. Such companies realized good gains for the bank when sold e.g. Roto Pack and Techno Pack.Loans &amp; advancesIt is worth mentioning that the Bank's loans and advances portfolio has experienced several phases of progress throughout the history of the Bank. At the beginning, the bank focused on medium term finance for export projects or those that aim at exports in order to increase the export capacity of the country thus propagating the culture of production for export and not export of surplus products.In a subsequent phase, the bank expanded to focus on financing the working capital of different sectors of the economy.The global financial crisis at the end of the twentieth century that hit the banking sector in Egypt left behind it several criticized and troubled debts that had, in turn, its effects on our Bank. Subsequently, our Bank encountered some difficulties as a result of having a high segment of exporters who deal with the external world, thus encountering some problems which, in turn, had its effects on the credit portfolio. Nevertheless, through its efforts and due to its high coverage ratio and credit worthiness, the bank became one of the most reputable high ranking institutions regarding the quality of its loan portfolio.  0.000055\n",

All attempts so far have been too complex or expensive in the trade receivables area to truly scale beyond niche providers. Due to breakthroughs in modern technology, machine learning &amp; quantitative finance we've been able to develop a solution that converts these heterogeneous trade receivables into a highly liquid, standardized, non-correlated asset class that can be traded with extremely low overhead on the AREX exchange.We're committed in driving a € 25 billion annual decrease in the current financing gap by the year 2020 and our vision is to ultimately abolish that financing gap completely. AREX will empower SMEs to access affordable short–term financing and fuel their growth while providing great investment opportunities to investors in the form of this newly minted asset class.

We were both working for separate companies as programmers and decided to quit our jobs and pursue a joint online venture. Our vision was to create a company that offered valuable services and friendly support. We pursued a variety of online services and Web Hosting was the one that took off. In 1997 we registered a new domain name for our hosting service: #URL_2771e4edd228ef87552e362150f20348a34b18e80ce17121963d732c43640283# We never advertised our hosting service but it grew steadily by word-of-mouth for several years. As competition for shared hosting services got fierce, we shifted our focus to custom dedicated servers. Our average hosting customer has been with us for 10+ years.Over the years we learned how important spam filtering was to our hosting customers. We created three different spam filtering products (the first two were strictly for our hosting customers). In 2008 we realized we were in a good position to create a stand-alone spam filtering service that would benefit both our hosting customers and provide an additional stream of income. SpamHero was born and quickly became an important part of our business and has opened the doors to many other opportunities. 0.000043\n",

It uses the mobile technology to connect directly taxi drivers and passengers in the same way that Google AdWords connects advertisers and Internet users: taxi drivers advertise their location and availability to nearby passengers who are searching for a taxi using their Taxibeat mobile app. It consists of two mobile applications, one for taxi drivers and one for passengers. While drivers use the application to declare their position and availability, passengers use the Taxibeat app to virtually \"see\" all nearby available taxi drivers, in a range of about 2 kms. They see every possible information about each driver (distance, car model, customers' rating, services provided, etc) and select which driver to hail with a touch on the screen. Taxibeat launched with great success at May 2011 in Athens Greece, and now expands in a number of countries like Brazil, France, Romania and Norway.

Mr. Reynolds remained a loyal customer of Dayton Toyota until his passing a few years ago. In addition to being on of the oldest Toyota Dealers in the United States, Dayton Toyota has received numerous awards for our outstanding treatment of our loyal customers.  Dayton Toyota is an award winning dealership, receiving the prestigious Toyota President's Award in 2009.  Starting in 2005, Toyota also began recognizing their dealers who achieve excellence at meeting and exceeding customer expectations at every opportunity with elite \"Signature\" status.  Out of several hundred Toyota dealers in the New York Region, only 14 currently meet the rigorous Signature requirements.  Dayton Toyota has been recognized by Toyota as a Signature Certified dealer every single year.  As a customer, this means that you are always in competent and caring hands at Dayton Toyota.  You'll never experience high-pressure tactics and you will find expert advice and our best prices possible for all of your automotive needs.  Despite our accomplishments, we aim to continuously improve our service to you.  Drive up anytime at our No-Appointment-Necessary Express Lube; experience our 1 Hour Express Delivery Service; take advantage of ourOnline Guaranteed Service Appointments, Complimentary Loaner Cars and Shuttle Service and On-Site Toyota Certified Collision Center; or relax in our State-Of-The-Art Customer Lounge with Free Wireless Internet Service, our \"Quiet Room\" with Personal Computer Workstations, complimentary refreshments and children's play area.  We will always honor you as our welcome guest and promise to respect your time and priorities.Mr. Reynolds philosophy of treating every customer like family has been translated today into our Dayton Toyota 12 Point Value Guarantee. 0.000022\n",

An avid texter, Ford couldn't believe businesses did not have a way to receive text messages. Ford bought a cell phone for the coffee shop to keep by the register so he could text his order in each morning.I hate 2 wait for most anything!\"The idea quickly caught on and out-grew the capability of a cell phone. He thought, if he saves 15 minutes each morning by texting in his order, then more businesses could benefit from texting. Working with operators, Ford then created Zingle, a business text solution that allows customers to text a business (or automatically print the text request) and responds to customers with a confirmation, while also keeping a log of all recent requests and conversations. 0.000017\n",

Primarily three ways. First we spread risk of the investor’s funds over a team of traders and trading strategies. So no one trader can harm the fund. This allows us as well, to profit in all market conditions – as different trading strategies at different times can provide. “The power of the many is greater than the power of one.” Secondly, we have new technology in place to ensure that strict trader targets and controls are adhered to (via our real-time risk manager) as well as provide trader tools (for example the Trading Floor and the Toolbox) to enable trader success. Finally, Blue Point Trading has in place an “engine” to recruit and build this team of traders to perform the trading. We accomplish this via our unique Trader Programme. 0.000011\n",

A real store that you can walk in to and browse products, no appointment repair service and a training center are just some of ways we make your decision to work with Create More an easy one.At Create More, we want to be more than the Apple computer dealer where you buy your new Macintosh, iPads, iPods, peripherals and accessories. We want to be your source for support and information too. When you refer to your friend who knows about computers, we want that to be us!Our staff is eager to answer your questions and work with you and provide you with the products and solutions you need. Pre and post sale support is equally important to us.  We want you to get the right computer and then make sure that it does what you need and you are comfortable using it!The relaxed boutique environment of our store is just the start of how we want you to enjoy your Mac experience.How do you go from business development to selling Macs? We’re glad you asked!In 1997, the seeds of Create More were planted. Looking for better ways to grow a business. What are the most effective marketing solutions? How should a business position itself? How to communicate these finding to clients?These were but a few questions that were the foundation of Create More. Through workshops, research, and partnerships, a solid base was built. Officially formed in 1999, Create More worked with clients to grow their businesses. In the process of learning about our clients, we also learned a lot about ourselves, but we’ll get to that shortlyIn working with our clients on their businesses, we found certain obstacles. To grow, focus needed to be kept on processes and not infrastructure. That’s just a fancy way of saying, you can’t win the race if you can find the keys to start your car.It became clear to us, that if we could simplify the day to day, our clients could then focus on the task at hand, building and growing their businesses. The more time we spent on simplifying the process of doing business, the more we realized technology was the biggest hurdle. The more we made recommendations on technology, the more we realized we needed to be the source of the technology we recommended and implemented.It wasn’t long before we realized our true calling. We took a hard look at what we were doing and what was most effective for our clients. Creating, managing, and implementing technology solutions would be far more valuable to our clients.We still continue to evolve and grow, and we always have our clients’ best interest in mind. Whether it’s a home user or a company with hundreds of users, we want to make sure the use of their Macs is productive, effective, and as easy as possible.With all of the web sites and big box stores, we’re happy to be a small, independently owned business with the one main goal in mind – you and your Mac. 0.000011\n",

We work across all levels within organisations to enable business agility for our clients.We work with clients from vision and concept to delivery to ensure that programmes and projects start off right.

Startups are teams of excellent people that develop products to solve a need or a pain of thousands or millions of customers with repeatable &amp; scalable business models. Most of the product features a startup team develops will get thrown away very quickly and replaced by newer, better ones, others will be modified, and maybe the entire startup will pivot to an entirely new direction at some point in its life cycle.Team members in a startup like Offerial must understand that there are no role limitations &amp; no concrete job descriptions as one might expect to find in large(r) companies. Team members may start doing a certain job when they join the team and may end up 6 months later doing something completely different and this is perfectly normal. Actually, we love it when this happens!We love people who have a short learning curve that have the habit of learning new things (even things that may seem of no importance), people who are open to new ideas as well as lean &amp; agile.We deeply appreciate people who are able to let go and not get attached on things they worked really hard to achieve, if the new one is better, and in general people constantly excited by change, new challenges and the \"impossible situations\" where for the first few hours/weeks there doesn't be to be a solution to a problem!We do not judge people's abilities based on university degrees or fancy titles. We only care about each person's satisfaction &amp; ability to deliver and to strive at what we do. 0.000007\n",

      "2497) company_profile_GoRefi is building a platform for automating the front-end mortgage origination process, an annual $1.8T vertical that ultimately touches the lives of over 70 million Americans.The Right Candidate Will Relate To The Following:Find BalanceWe work a lot. Sometimes we sleep in the office. Sometimes we chat with clients at 3am. Sometimes we don't sleep at all. We work on weekends. We're hustlers and thrive on the craziness. But, we all have balanced lives outside of work and prioritize those things that are important to us. Family, friends, nights out, music, and the abundant nature that exists outside of our beautiful city - we play just as hard as we work.Defend or DieAt GoRefi, we're insanely passionate about fixing our broken industry. Transparency with our clients is paramount so it's only natural that our work environment embody the same openness. With so many ideas and only so much bandwidth to execute, open communication is key. We're small, lean, and nimble so your opinion is expected and respected. But, when you present an idea, be ready to defend it - because we question everything. It's this type of collaboration that helps us decide what to focus our energies on next.Strive for PerfectionWe fail every day, and it's awesome, because it means we're getting closer. There's a push to get our features out there and it's often a sacrifice to hit those deadlines, but given the sensitive nature of what GoRefi does, putting features out just for the sake of putting features out doesn't fly. We prefer to take a bit of extra time to do it right, even though we're moving at light speed compared to our competitors.Don't be a \"Larry\"No offense if your name is Larry, of course. In this example, Larry's the typical used-car salesman selling you rust protection when you live in California or the fly-by-night mortgage broker charging you exorbitant fees and putting you in the wrong loan. This lie-cheat-steal crap is all over the web and in case you couldn't tell already - we're sick of it. A Larry is enticed by quotas - not service - and is compensated without justification of hours worked or exceptional performance. They sell for themselves and for their wallet, with a short-term vision that hurts everyone in their lives, especially their customers. At GoRefi, we don't have a Sales Department - we only have Support. Our clients get what's best for them and only them. Our motive is and always will be to ensure that our clients are happy with their experience. 0.000007\n",

I’ve kept the agency small on purpose. We choose to work with brands and people who inspire us. Because of our vast and varied experience, we’re able to learn a new client’s business very quickly. We don’t waste time with a lot of process—we jump in with both feet and get to work, learning the language of your brand and working with you to communicate it more effectively with your target market. We help you define your brand so that the message we share really works. And we carefully choose how and where we tell your story.Our clients get big agency resources with boutique agency service and style. When we’ve had the luxury to work with big brands that had big budgets, they have all been pleasantly surprised to hear that my assessment on day one matches the results they find after months (and thousands of dollars’ worth) of consumer analysis.We’re smart, efficient, scrappy and have a lot of fun. Check out the Website and give us a call—we still answer the phone.Looking forward,Kim 0.000003\n",

Online teaching platforms are a great way for students and teachers to find one another. A third party website allows students to create a profile listing their educational needs, and teachers can create a profile with their teaching services. The website than makes it easy for teachers to connect with potential students, with ways to build an online profile with a strong reputation as well as advertisements for teachers to display their teaching. Teachers can spend less time on marketing their services, and more time teaching online. They can simply sign up and will be easily connected with students who need help learning a subject. The website will take care of the rest, from managing the services to helping the teachers connect with the students. One of the biggest barriers for teachers to teach online is not knowing how to get started. Many teachers would be willing to tutor or teach online if they did not have to invest a great deal of their time in getting started.

We like good people, and we like really thrilling people. When those two things come together it’s a talent experience for the books. The biggest asset we have is our talent, and we take that seriously. Part of the IPG agency network, we have over 30 offices on six continents with more than 2,000 amazingly talented people in our family working together. And, it’s kind of awesome to be a part of a company working with some incredible brands, including American Express, Coca-Cola, Mondelez, Microsoft, Walmart, William Grant &amp; Sons and more. Why not join us?

      "4285) company_profile_Who is Powershop?We operate in an industry dominated by crusty utilities operating at glacial pace and with a fetish for technical jargon and industry complexity. So we created a business with a plan to change the world. Well, a small part of the world anyway. To establish a new electricity retailing business centered around continuous customer orientated innovation. Our strong belief is that disruptive change is the only way this can be achieved.So...we built a shop. A shop where customers can buy power. Simply a Powershop – no less, no more. Well, actually we are a whole lot more! In creating a shop, our aim is to change customer attitudes, and behaviors around electricity use and purchase. We aim to create a new breed of electricity consumer – an engaged consumer – one that is aware, informed and responsive. A consumer that finally knows what they are buying. A consumer that is truly in control of their power.What does Powershop stand for?So what lights our fire?First and foremost we stand for the customer. Yeah, whatever? Heard it all before. No really, we stand for the customer. We provide a shop, and focus on delivering customers excellent service, and enhancing and extending our services to deliver on ever changing customer needs and wants. That said, our focus is on delivering to contemporary shoppers – who value flexibility and choice – through contemporary shopping channels.We also thrive on transparency. This is the pre-requisite to delivering on our commitment to put customers in control of their power. It is also pre-requisite to establishing our credibility and indeed ensuring we are also appropriately disciplined in delivering on customer needs and wants.Finally, simplicity is a must. If buying electricity is not as simple as buying milk we have failed.  0.000001\n",

It carries out state-of-the-art basic and applied research in collaboration with other world-leading research centers.  The activities of NOA are organized in 3 institutes staffed with high quality scientific, research and technical personnel:  the Institute of Astronomy, Astrophysics, Space Applications and Remote Sensing, the Institute of Environmental Research and Sustainable Development, and  the Geodynamics Institute.NOA’s research activities are focused on the terrestrial interior, the atmospheric environment and Space, from the interplanetary medium to the astronomical Universe. Basic and applied research is conducted by using observational data from hundreds of ground based stations and several modern space probes. The Centre, with its rich scientific outcomes and activities, is linked to entrepreneurship, culture, education and the popularization of science. NOA offers critical social services, such as a daily monitoring of seismicity and issuing earthquake alerts to the Greek State Authorities on a 24/7 basis, weather forecasting, forest fires monitoring, ionospheric activity recording, continuation of a 150 years long climatic dataset and operation of one of the largest European telescopes. It also provides the national gate to the European Space Agency.

Only after this has been considered will we consider the impact of our decisions on FBN, followed by our fellow team members, and finally ourselves. Before making a decision, we listen to farmers and learn about how implementing it will impact them.While making a decision or working on a project, we prefer working in small teams to make sure our employees feel empowered and own their decisions. Finally, after our decisions are made, we communicate those decisions to our farmers and to the rest of the team.FBN employees are a diverse group with a common passion for agriculture. We respect humility, value honesty, and despise entitlement. We see farmers as hackers and entrepreneurs, able to fix things with duct tape and baling wire while predicting the weather and analysing their financial position on the commodities market. Just like farmers, we believe that if something is broken, it’s better to fix it than to complain about it.All FBN employees, regardless of the position, will spend meaningful time visiting farms, to meet with some of our founding and network farmers in order to discuss their equipment and data collection practices.As a Silicon Valley based company with a Midwestern culture, we believe in the power of getting things done, and understand that creativity is fostered by trust and the ability to focus. As a result, meetings are avoided and we respect everyone’s right to at least one day a week without meetings. Thursdays are considered “no meeting days.”Finally, there are no shrinking violets here. The team consists of many people with deep experience in agriculture, technology, data science, machine learning, physics among other areas. So be prepared to offer opinions!Interviewing at FBNOur interview panels are as diverse as our employees. You may be expected to interview with an agronomist, a physicist, a data scientist, and because of our strong focus on farmers, we expect every FBN candidate to interview with one of our founding farmers, advisory board members or network members. As a result, our interviews will take you out of your comfort zone.

We are incubated by YUZA, one of Europe's leading app experience companies. We are already working with app developers, helping them use Pollen to grow their app store revenues and chart positions.

That is why RLG is dedicated to helping clients like you with consumer injury, mass tort, and medical product liability lawsuits. Unlike other law firms that solicit mass tort victims as “clients”, then, for a referral fee, pass off that information to other lawyers, RLG remains your lawyer throughout the process of seeking compensation for your injuries.
